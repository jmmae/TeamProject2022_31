Team Project for Team 31

For local hosting you require express, body-parser, cors and mysql. 
You would need to have a mysql database setup. To setup the database either setup a database called oaxaca with the user being root and password being teamproject or if you wish to use your own mysql database setup then to change the values of user, password and database in the con variable in the file DatabaseConnection.js accordingly.

Then you would run the Populate.js file to create and setup the table with some menu items. Then when running the website you would run node DatabaseConnection.js.
